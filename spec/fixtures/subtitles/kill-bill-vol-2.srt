1
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,145
Master...

2
00:45:18,815 --> 00:45:20,440
Your Mandarin is lousy.

3
00:45:21,373 --> 00:45:22,681
It causes my ears discomfort.

4
00:45:22,748 --> 00:45:24,274
You bray like an ass!

5
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:27,089
You are not to speak unless spoken to.

6
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,405
Is it too much to hope...
you understand Cantonese?

7
00:45:34,995 --> 00:45:36,423
I speak Japanese very well...

8
00:45:36,498 --> 00:45:39,562
I didn't ask if you speak Japanese...

9
00:45:39,632 --> 00:45:41,802
I asked if you understand Cantonese?

10
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:49,185
You are here to learn the mysteries of
Kung Fu, not linguistics.

11
00:45:49,577 --> 00:45:53,186
If you can't understand me... I will
communicate with you like I would a dog.

12
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:56,729
When I yell, when I point, when I beat you
with my stick!

13
00:46:02,433 --> 00:46:04,341
Bill is your master, is he not?

14
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:14,321
Your master tells me...
you're not entirely unschooled.

15
00:46:14,392 --> 00:46:15,700
What training do you possess?

16
00:46:24,273 --> 00:46:27,718
The exquisite art of the Samurai sword.
Don't make me laugh!

17
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:31,617
Your so-called exquisite art,
is only fit for...

18
00:46:31,692 --> 00:46:33,446
Japanese fat heads!

19
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:43,293
Your anger amuses me. Do you believe
you are my match?

20
00:46:43,811 --> 00:46:44,378
No.

21
00:46:45,186 --> 00:46:47,073
Are you aware I kill at will?

22
00:46:47,713 --> 00:46:48,727
Yes.

23
00:46:49,215 --> 00:46:50,556
Is it your wish to die?

24
00:46:50,942 --> 00:46:51,291
No.

25
00:46:53,373 --> 00:46:54,266
Then you must be stupid...

26
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,600
Then you must be stupid... so stupid.

27
00:46:56,667 --> 00:47:00,242
Rise, and let me look at your
ridiculous face.

28
00:47:00,727 --> 00:47:01,839
Rise.

29
00:47:06,196 --> 00:47:11,560
So my pathetic friend...
Is there anything that you can do well?

30
00:47:12,399 --> 00:47:14,253
What's the matter?

31
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:16,523
Cat got your tongue?

32
00:47:17,931 --> 00:47:20,777
- Oh yes, you speak Japanese.

33
00:47:21,385 --> 00:47:22,758
I despise the Goddamn Japs!

34
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:27,327
Go to that rack.

35
00:47:35,296 --> 00:47:36,223
Remove the sword.

36
00:48:01,453 --> 00:48:03,175
Let's see how good you really are.

37
00:48:04,012 --> 00:48:05,571
If...

38
00:48:06,218 --> 00:48:07,842
...you land a single blow,

39
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:11,169
I'll bow down and call you master.

40
00:48:24,828 --> 00:48:27,128
From here you can get an excellent
view of my foot.

41
00:48:32,151 --> 00:48:35,346
Your swordsmanship... is amateur at best.

42
00:48:48,908 --> 00:48:54,022
Your so-called kung-fu... is really...
quite pathetic.

43
00:48:56,742 --> 00:49:00,384
I asked you to demonstrate... what you know
- and you did...

44
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:02,204
Not a goddamn thing!

45
00:49:03,234 --> 00:49:06,712
Let's see your Tiger Crane...
match my Eagle's Claw.

46
00:50:01,497 --> 00:50:03,384
Like all Yankee women...

47
00:50:03,448 --> 00:50:06,794
...all you can do is order in restaurants
and spend a man's money.

48
00:50:07,893 --> 00:50:09,550
Excruciating... isn't it?

49
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,731
Yes!

50
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:13,517
If it was my wish...

51
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,276
...I could chop your arm off.

52
00:50:17,966 --> 00:50:20,168
It's my arm now. I can do what I please.

53
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:22,917
If you can stop me... I suggest you try.

54
00:50:25,065 --> 00:50:26,013
I can't.

55
00:50:27,143 --> 00:50:28,320
Because you're helpless?

56
00:50:29,158 --> 00:50:30,019
Yes.

57
00:50:32,548 --> 00:50:34,554
Have you ever felt this before?

58
00:50:34,946 --> 00:50:35,708
No.

59
00:50:36,065 --> 00:50:39,227
Compared to me... you're as helpless
as a worm fighting an eagle?

60
00:50:40,191 --> 00:50:41,335
YES!!!

61
00:50:43,452 --> 00:50:44,150
THAT'S THE BEGINNING!

62
00:50:49,687 --> 00:50:52,206
Is it your wish to possess this
kind of power?

63
00:50:57,842 --> 00:51:00,491
Your training will begin... tomorrow.

64
00:51:08,906 --> 00:51:10,215
Since your arm now belongs to me...

65
00:51:11,081 --> 00:51:12,324
...I want it strong.

66
00:51:13,831 --> 00:51:15,171
Can you do that?

67
00:51:16,804 --> 00:51:18,396
I can, but not that close.

68
00:51:18,564 --> 00:51:19,807
Then you can't do it.

69
00:51:20,993 --> 00:51:24,603
What if your enemy... is three inches
in front of you...

70
00:51:25,631 --> 00:51:26,840
...What do you do then...

71
00:51:27,933 --> 00:51:28,980
...Curl into a ball...

72
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:31,796
...or do you put your FIST through him?

73
00:51:33,306 --> 00:51:34,036
Now begin.

74
00:52:04,931 --> 00:52:08,823
It's the wood that should fear your hand...
- not the other way around.

75
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:15,128
No wonder you can't do it... you acquiesce
to defeat... before you even begin.

76
00:53:59,091 --> 00:54:01,228
If you want to eat like a dog...

77
00:54:02,449 --> 00:54:04,358
You can live and sleep outside like a dog.

78
00:54:06,766 --> 00:54:08,587
If you want to live and sleep
like a human...

79
00:54:10,124 --> 00:54:11,552
...pick up those sticks.

80
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,440
Elle, you treacherous dog.

81
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,300
I - give - you - my - word...
